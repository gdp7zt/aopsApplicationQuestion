# Application Question

Feel free to check out the live build: https://gdp7zt.github.io/aopsApplicationQuestion/

The function that solves the pyramid can be found in this file: https://github.com/gdp7zt/aopsApplicationQuestion/blob/main/solution/src/components/solvePyramid.js titled dfs.


The rest is just boiler plate to get more practice in with react as I am currently learning more about it!
